# Hardening & UX TODO

Working list from the June 2026 security review follow-up. Items are ordered
by the sequence they're being implemented in, not priority. Checked items are
done and committed on this branch.

## Phase 1 — CI / release pipeline (config-only)

- [x] Dependabot: add `cargo` ecosystem (currently only `github-actions`)
- [x] Release: emit `SHA256SUMS` alongside the archives
- [x] Release: GitHub artifact attestation (build provenance) on published archives
- [x] CI: `cargo audit` job (RUSTSEC advisories) on lockfile changes + weekly

## Phase 2 — CLI / GUI quick wins

- [x] Warn when programming Molto2 seeds under the factory-default customer key
- [x] `info`: warn when device clock drifts >30s from host (suggest `sync-time`)
- [x] GUI: clear the seed draft field after a successful write
- [x] GUI: auto-clear clipboard ~45s after copying an OTP code

## Phase 3 — memory hygiene round 2

- [x] Zeroize `PinUvAuthToken` and the CTAP shared secrets on drop
- [x] Zeroize CLI-side secret strings (`read_secret` / `gather_secret` returns)
- [x] Zeroize imported TOTP seeds: `BulkEntry.secret` and `OtpAuth.secret`
      wipe on drop (with Debug redacted to the byte count), and the decrypted
      Aegis plaintext, GA migration buffers, and decoded QR payloads ride in
      `Zeroizing` wrappers end to end

## Phase 4 — documentation

- [x] `SECURITY.md`: threat model, the no-network-access invariant, secret
      handling guarantees, disclosure process
- [x] README: document Windows elevation requirements for FIDO HID access

## Phase 5 — CLI features

- [x] `completions` subcommand (shell completions via clap_complete)
- [x] `manpage` subcommand (troff output via clap_mangen)
- [x] `import-file --dry-run`: print the slot/title/config plan without
      touching the device — *already existed upstream; verified working*
- [x] `doctor` subcommand: diagnose pcscd, readers, udev rules, hidraw
      access, keys.json permissions
- [x] Destructive commands (`fido-reset`, `fido-creds-delete`,
      `factory-reset`): show the resolved friendly name + serial in the
      confirmation/refusal message

## Phase 6 — fuzzing

- [x] `fuzz/` crate with cargo-fuzz targets for the hand-rolled parsers:
      otpauth URI, base32, CBOR, OATH TLV, OpenPGP BER-TLV, PIV BER
- [x] Scheduled CI job running each target briefly (nightly toolchain)

## crates.io publish runbook (readiness verified 2026-06)

All crates carry version/license/description metadata and `cargo package`
succeeds for every crate without in-workspace deps; the rest resolve once
their deps are live (normal first-publish ordering). With a crates.io token
(`cargo login`), publish in this order, waiting ~a minute between tiers for
index propagation:

1. `keyroost-proto`, `keyroost-hid`, `keyroost-keyring`, `keyroost-rsakey`
2. `keyroost-ctap`, `keyroost-oath`, `keyroost-openpgp`, `keyroost-piv`,
   `keyroost-token2otp` (all leaf byte layers — no in-workspace deps),
   `keyroost-import`
3. `keyroost-transport` (needs proto/oath/openpgp/piv/token2otp), then
   `keyroost-resolve` (needs transport) and `keyroost-qr` (needs import)
4. `keyroostctl`, `keyroost`

Afterwards `cargo install keyroostctl` / `cargo install keyroost` work for
anyone with the Linux build prerequisites from the README.

## Deferred — decisions or external work needed

- [x] **QR code import** — done: keyroost-qr crate (rqrr/png/jpeg-decoder
      exception), PNG+JPEG screenshots, Google Authenticator migration
      batches, CLI `import --qr` / `import-file <image>`, GUI drag-drop,
      fuzz targets, end-to-end fixtures.
- [x] **Packaging** — automated fanout in .github/workflows/publish.yml
      (crates.io via OIDC trusted publishing, AUR, Homebrew tap, winget),
      templates + one-time setup steps in packaging/. Remaining manual:
      the account/secret setup and first publishes per packaging/README.md.
      Flatpak ruled out (pcscd/hidraw sandboxing).
- [x] **Branch/tag protection (light)** — repository rulesets: `v*` tag
      creation/update/deletion is admin-only (tag push is release
      authority), and `main` rejects force-pushes and deletion for
      everyone. Direct pushes to `main` remain allowed.
- [ ] **Branch protection (full)** — require PR + green CI for `main`.
      Deliberately deferred until the product is feature-complete and
      stable: it ends the direct-push workflow, so adopt it when release
      cadence slows.
- [x] **PIV write path** — DONE + hardware-verified (2026-06-12). Byte layer
      (GENERAL AUTHENTICATE, GENERATE, PUT DATA cert, CHANGE REFERENCE / RESET
      RETRY COUNTER, Yubico SET MGMT KEY / SET PIN RETRIES / GET METADATA /
      RESET, SPKI→PEM), transport (AES/3DES mutual management-key auth + all
      write ops, scoped aes/des/getrandom dep), CLI (`keyroostctl piv`
      change-pin/puk, unblock-pin, set-retries, change-management-key,
      generate-key, import-cert, export-cert, reset), and the full GUI PIV
      pane. Generalizes across PIV devices since it's a NIST standard.
- [ ] **Publish-channel accounts** — one-time setup per packaging/README.md
      before the first release: the `release-publish` environment approval
      gate, crates.io account + manual first publish + trusted-publisher
      grants, AUR account/SSH key + first `keyroost-bin` push, the Homebrew
      tap repo + `TAP_PUSH_TOKEN`, and the manual first winget submission +
      `WINGET_TOKEN`. Channels can be enabled one at a time; unset secrets
      skip cleanly.
- [x] **GUI: move slow imports off the frame loop** — QR decode, vault
      decrypt, and export parse run on a dedicated import thread (not the
      device worker, which serializes card I/O behind whatever runs on it);
      the dialog shows a spinner and blocks Load / Program all while one is
      in flight.
- [x] **Wayland clipboard clear** — documented in the README as best-effort
      on pure-Wayland sessions without XWayland clipboard sync (no complete
      fix known; wl-data-control is wlroots-only).
- [x] **CI cache for fuzz/audit jobs** — Swatinem/rust-cache (cache-bin
      covers the installed binaries) added to both workflows.
- [x] **Clipboard conditional clear** — done via arboard (already in the
      tree through eframe): clears only when the clipboard still holds the
      copied code; fails open if unreadable.

## v0.6.0 — CLI maturity & device-centric model (branch: `v0.6.0-cli-maturity`)

Holistic pass over `keyroostctl` (and the shared plumbing the GUI uses):
confirm the workflows make sense, dedup, fix the device-identification root
cause, and add the friendly device overview. **Breaking CLI changes** — done
deliberately now while pre-1.0 and the user base is small, landed as one
coherent release with a migration note.

Context: this follows two reader-name misidentification bugs (#21: a Token2
PIN+ then a PIN+R3 "3.2 mini" both mis-seen as a Molto2). v0.5.1 stopped the
bleed by matching only the "molto" product word; v0.6.0 replaces name-matching
with stable identifiers.

### Phase 0 — Command-surface inventory (DONE 2026-06-14; read-only)
Enumerated every `keyroostctl` command from clap: **61 leaf commands across 8
domains** + the bare invocation + 8 global flags. Map and findings below; the
two breaking-rename decisions it surfaced are recorded under Phase 3.

Surface (leaf-command counts):
- **Global/utility (5):** *(bare)* → currently Molto2 `info`, `info`, `list`,
  `doctor`, `completions`/`manpage`.
- **Molto2 (flat, 10):** info, set-seed, set-title, configure, sync-time,
  set-customer-key, import, import-file, probe, factory-reset.
- **FIDO (flat, 8):** fido-info, fido-reset, fido-pin-retries, fido-pin-set,
  fido-pin-change, fido-creds-metadata, fido-creds-list, fido-creds-delete.
- **key-name (nested, 3):** add, list, remove.
- **oath (nested, 6):** list, code, add, delete, set-password, clear-password
  *(Yubico/Trussed applet)*.
- **openpgp (nested, 10):** status, verify, public-key, reset, set-name,
  set-url, generate-key, import-key, sign, decrypt.
- **piv (nested, 12):** status, change-pin, change-puk, unblock-pin,
  set-retries, change-management-key, generate-key, import-cert, export-cert,
  request-cert, self-sign, reset.
- **otp (nested, 8):** list, get, add, delete, erase-all, serial, button-hotp,
  delete-button-hotp *(Token2 OTP-on-FIDO)*.

Findings:
1. **Three command shapes coexist** — Molto2 flat+un-namespaced (`set-seed`),
   FIDO flat+prefixed (`fido-creds-list`), the rest nested (`piv status`).
   Nothing tells a reader `set-seed` is Molto2-only.
2. **Four device-targeting idioms, none unified** — Molto2 implicit-single,
   FIDO `--path` (hidraw), OATH/OpenPGP/PIV `--reader <substr>` (PC/SC), OTP
   `--transport`. The friendly-name `--name` feeds **only** FIDO resolution, so
   a named key can't be targeted for piv/oath/openpgp. Real gap, not cosmetic.
3. **Secret-input flags re-declared per variant** — `<noun>-env`/`<noun>-stdin`
   is consistent but only OATH flattens it (`OathAccess`); OpenPGP and PIV
   repeat `--reader` + PIN flags inline everywhere. Dedup target for Phase 3.
4. **Verb drift** — "set" vs "change" for the same act; "reset" in four places.
5. **Confusable twins** — `oath`(Yubico) vs `otp`(Token2); `info` ≡ bare;
   `list` overlaps `key-name list`.
6. **`probe`** is a bring-up/research tool living in the main user surface —
   hide it (`#[command(hide = true)]` or a `dev`/`debug` namespace).
7. **No `--json` anywhere** — all human-text (→ Phase 4).
8. Bare-invocation Molto2-default confirmed at `main.rs:1411` (`Session::open`
   → `read_info`) — the `SW=6A81` wart, retired in Phase 2.

### Phase 1 — Shared device model
Lift the device-correlation logic (HID↔PC/SC pairing, capability union,
Molto2-vs-key classification) out of the GUI crate (`keyroost/src/ui/device.rs`)
into a shared library crate consumed by **both** GUI and CLI, so they stop
drifting. (This is a **new crate name** — its first crates.io publish must be
manual with the personal token, then add its Trusted Publishing entry, exactly
like `keyroost-token2otp`. Keep the personal token until v0.6.0 ships for this
reason; revoke afterward.) Replace reader-name Molto2 detection with stable identifiers:
USB PID (Molto2 = `0x0300`) and/or the architectural fact that the Molto2 is
the only Token2 device with no FIDO HID interface.

**Dependency RESOLVED — Token2 answered the PID issue (#25, 2026-06-15):**
- `0x349E:0x0300` is **always and only** the Molto2 and **will not change** —
  confirmed authoritative. This is now the primary detection signal.
- The full PID→product map is published and captured in code as
  `keyroost_proto::TOKEN2_PRODUCTS` (+ `token2_product`, `is_molto2_usb`,
  `token2_pid_label`). Token2 submits new PIDs to the CCID repo, so the table
  can grow; unknown PIDs fall through to "not provably a Molto2" → cross-checks.
- Token2 cautioned that the `READ_CONFIG` appearance field **can overlap** across
  products, so do **not** key on it — PID + product description is the contract.

Detection plan: where the USB PID is in hand (HID/USB enumeration), use
`is_molto2_usb(vid, pid)`. The bare PC/SC path only has a reader string, so keep
`is_molto2_reader` (name match) there, correlated to the USB side by topology
(the `CHANNEL_ID` bus/address pairing the transport already reads). Retain the
"no FIDO-HID sibling" architectural cross-check as defense in depth.

**ATR option (My1, #25/#21) — keep for the NFC future, verify before relying.**
My1 suggested classifying via the CCID **ATR** (as `pcsc_scan` does) rather than
the reader name. Honest assessment: it's the *right* tool over **NFC**, where
the reader is a generic contactless reader and neither USB PID nor reader name
denotes the card — if keyroost ever grows NFC support, ATR + AID-selection
becomes the only signal, so record it as the NFC strategy. For the **USB** case
it's weaker than the now-confirmed PID: (a) reading the ATR needs `SCardConnect`,
which resets the card — exactly the connect we avoid on the Molto2 during
enumeration; (b) the Token2 line may share a smartcard platform and present
indistinguishable ATRs across Molto2/FIDO — unverified, needs the 3.x hardware
Token2 offered (#21) before we'd trust it to discriminate. So: not the primary
USB discriminator, but a good cross-check and the clear NFC path.

### Phase 2 — Bare invocation + `list` redesign
Bare `keyroostctl` → friendly correlated overview (one row per physical device,
capability badges — GUI parity). `keyroostctl list` → repositioned as the
diagnostic dump, enriched with VID:PID + the computed classification (so the
next bug report hands us what My1's did, by design). Bare invocation rewired
exactly once, straight to the friendly form (no interim raw-list step).

### Phase 3 — Consistency pass (the breaking part)
**Decisions (locked from Phase 0, 2026-06-14):**
- **Nest every device under a named group.** FIDO flat → `fido <sub>`, *and*
  Molto2 flat → `molto <sub>` (full symmetry — every device is a group; the
  bare invocation is the only top-level entry that touches a device). So:
  `molto set-seed`, `fido creds list`, `piv status`, `oath list`, `otp list`.
  Top level keeps only the device-agnostic utilities (bare overview, `list`,
  `doctor`, `completions`, `manpage`) + the group names.
- **Unify device targeting fully.** One resolution path: `--name` (friendly)
  works for **every** group; `--reader <substr>` / `--path` / `--transport`
  become aliases/inputs into that one resolver (built on the Phase 1 shared
  device model), not parallel idioms. `--key*` stays Molto2-scoped.

Also: align verb/noun naming across groups ("set" vs "change"; the four
`reset`s become `<group> reset`), hide `probe` from the main surface, and dedup
shared plumbing — secret input (env/stdin), device resolution,
session-open-and-announce — extend the existing `open_piv` / `open_openpgp`
helper pattern to FIDO / OATH / Molto2 / OTP. Land all renames in one change
with a clear migration note (old → new command map). The README and every
`docs/*.html` page document the *current* flat surface, so they go stale the
instant these renames land — they must be updated in the same change (Phase 6),
not after.

### Phase 4 — Feature gaps
Per-device parity audit (esp. the Token2 OTP CLI merged in #24 — confirm it
covers enumerate / add / delete / config / button-HOTP). Evaluate a `--json`
output mode for scripting (everything is human-text today). Note any missing
per-device operations.

### Phase 5 — Bug sweep + hardware workflow walkthrough
Fresh per-device end-to-end pass on available hardware (YubiKey, Solo 2,
Molto2; Token2 FIDO via the vendor / @My1). The bare-invocation "is the device
plugged in?" wart is retired here as a side effect of Phase 2.

### Phase 6 — Documentation sync (ships with the release, not after)
The user-facing docs currently describe an incomplete, soon-to-change product;
bring them level with reality before tagging. Concretely:
- **README is stale on Token2.** The "What it does" list, the "Supported
  devices" table, the Quick-start examples, and the GUI-tabs line all still
  frame the project around the Molto2 ("The original target") and omit the
  **Token2 FIDO security keys (T2F2 / PIN+)** entirely — even though on-device
  TOTP/HOTP for them shipped in 0.5.0 (the `otp` group) and #27 adds OTP over
  CCID, an interface enable/disable command, full-serial read, and a touch-HOTP
  GUI dialog. Add the device, its capabilities, and `otp` examples; the
  Contributors note already acknowledges the feature, so the body contradicts
  itself today.
- **Every command example must follow the Phase 3 renames.** README Quick-start
  + all `docs/*.html` use the flat `fido-*` commands and the bare-Molto2 `info` /
  `import` form; after Phase 3 these become `fido …` and `molto …`. Sweep
  `README.md`, `fido2.html`, `reset.html`, `molto2.html`, `index.html` (the
  already-nested `oath` / `openpgp` / `piv` / `key-name` examples are unaffected).
- **Migration note** (old → new command map) lands in the README and/or
  `CHANGELOG.md [0.6.0]`.
- **CHANGELOG `[0.6.0]`** entry written; **workspace version bumped** to 0.6.0
  (the branch does not bump it yet — still 0.5.1).
- The GitHub Pages site is served from `docs/` on `main`, so it goes live the
  moment this merges — there is no separate publish step to catch a lag.

### Sequencing
Phases 0–2 are additive/safe; Phase 3 is where breaking renames land — keep
them in one change with a clear migration note, and update the docs (Phase 6) in
that same change so the site never serves stale command syntax. Ship v0.6.0 only
once all phases are done, the docs are synced, the version is bumped, and the
release is walked through on hardware.
