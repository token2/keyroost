# keyroost

An independent, open-source Rust toolchain for managing hardware security keys —
across vendors — over PC/SC and USB HID. It speaks FIDO2/CTAP2, OATH (TOTP/HOTP),
and the OpenPGP and PIV card protocols, manages on-device OTP on Token2 FIDO keys,
and also programs the Token2 Molto2 / Molto2v2 TOTP token it started life
targeting. Ships a Rust library, a CLI (`keyroostctl`), and a
dark-themed desktop GUI (`keyroost`) — implemented from public standards, with no
vendor SDKs, no Python, and no Qt.

**New to hardware keys?** Read the companion guide —
[*"So you bought a hardware security key… now what?"*](https://framefilter.github.io/keyroost/) —
a short, vendor-neutral tour of what FIDO2, OATH, OpenPGP, and PIV actually do.

## What it does

- **FIDO2 / CTAP2** — enumerate authenticators, read `authenticatorGetInfo`,
  manage resident credentials (list / metadata / delete), set / change / verify
  the PIN, reset a key. PIN protocols v1 and v2.
- **OATH (TOTP/HOTP)** — list, add, delete, and compute codes over PC/SC,
  including applet-password set / clear / unlock.
- **OpenPGP card (v3.4)** — read status; generate or import RSA-2048 keys (host
  keygen or a PKCS#1/PKCS#8 PEM/DER file); sign (SHA-256 or SHA-1); decrypt; set
  cardholder name / URL; register a key for GnuPG; factory-reset the applet.
- **PIV (SP 800-73-4)** — full management: status (applet/firmware version,
  serial, PIN retries, which slots 9A/9C/9D/9E hold a certificate), on-card key
  generation, certificate import / export, self-signed certs or a CSR for a CA,
  and PIN / PUK / management-key changes and applet reset.
- **Token2 Molto2 / Molto2v2** — program a slot from an `otpauth://` URI;
  bulk-import from Aegis (plaintext or encrypted), 2FAS, or a list of `otpauth://`
  URIs; sync the host clock; rotate the customer key; factory reset.
- **Token2 on-device OTP (PIN+ Series FIDO keys)** — store TOTP/HOTP credentials
  directly on a Token2 FIDO security key and read their codes over USB-HID, NFC,
  or CCID; configure the single HOTP-on-touch keystroke slot; read the serial;
  and enable / disable the key's USB interfaces (FIDO / keyboard-HID / CCID).
- **Friendly device names** — an opt-in `keys.json` registry to target a specific
  physical key by name when several are connected, instead of by a reshuffling
  `/dev/hidrawN` path. Destructive operations always resolve to an explicit
  target, never a default.

## Supported devices

| Device | Capabilities | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Token2 Molto2 / Molto2v2** | TOTP slot programming | The original target. |
| **Token2 PIN+ Series** | FIDO2 (+ bio), OTP, OpenPGP, PIV | FIDO2 with fingerprint/bio enrollment and FIDO Metadata Service (MDS) display, plus on-device OTP (TOTP/HOTP, incl. HID/keyboard HOTP) over USB-HID / NFC / CCID — all validated on PIN+ hardware. Contributed by [@token2](https://github.com/token2). The OATH / OpenPGP / PIV smart-card applets are handled by the standard byte layers but **not yet exercised on PIN+ hardware by this project** (experimental). |
| **YubiKey** (5 series) | FIDO2, OATH, OpenPGP, PIV | Built and verified against a YubiKey 5.7. |
| **SoloKeys Solo 2** | FIDO2, OATH | Trussed firmware; no OpenPGP applet. |
| **Nitrokey 3** | FIDO2, OATH | Shares the Solo 2 / Trussed stack. |

Other CCID/FIDO devices implementing these standard applets may work; the table
is what the project has been built and tested against.

## Independence, trademarks & acknowledgements

keyroost is an independent implementation, **not affiliated with or endorsed by
any vendor named here.** It works with their products by implementing publicly
documented protocols; vendor and product names are used descriptively.

- *Token2* / *Molto2* — trademarks of **Token2 Sàrl**. The Molto2 protocol was
  determined by observing the device and its public reference tool; SM4 and SHA-1
  follow their published standards (GB/T 32907-2016, RFC 3174) and are checked
  against independent test vectors.
- *YubiKey* — trademark of **Yubico AB**.
- *Solo* / *Solo 2* — trademarks of **SoloKeys**; *Nitrokey* — trademark of
  **Nitrokey GmbH**.

A genuine thank-you to these teams for their work on everyone's security: Yubico
for helping create and champion U2F and FIDO2/WebAuthn and for publishing open
specs and tooling; SoloKeys and Nitrokey for open, auditable security-key
firmware and hardware (Nitrokey maintains the Trussed-based Solo 2 line); and
Token2 for affordable programmable hardware TOTP. keyroost also rests on open
standards from the FIDO Alliance, the OATH/IETF TOTP–HOTP RFCs, and the OpenPGP
card specification.

### Contributors

Beyond the maintainers, keyroost is grateful for community contributions:

- **[@token2](https://github.com/token2)** — contributed on-device TOTP/HOTP
  management for Token2 FIDO keys (PIN+ / FIDO2+), and published the protocol
  reference it was built from
  ([#24](https://github.com/framefilter/keyroost/pull/24)). Followed up with
  fingerprint/bio enrollment, FIDO Metadata Service (MDS) display, and a
  rounding-out of the on-device OTP support — all validated on real PIN+
  hardware ([#29](https://github.com/framefilter/keyroost/pull/29),
  [#30](https://github.com/framefilter/keyroost/pull/30)). Also added CTAP 2.1
  authenticator-config (security policy) and large-blob storage management,
  with a FIDO2 tab redesign
  ([#38](https://github.com/framefilter/keyroost/pull/38)).

(This credits their contribution to the codebase; it does not change keyroost's
independent status described above.)

## Design principles

- **Few dependencies, by design.** The protocol and codec layers are hand-written
  and pull in nothing: the Molto2 wire protocol (SM4, SHA-1, the MAC), base32, hex,
  CBOR, CTAP-HID framing, and the OATH / OpenPGP / PIV byte layers are all in-tree.
  External crates are added only when *not* doing so would be irresponsible or
  impractical — audited cryptography we won't hand-roll under `forbid(unsafe_code)`
  (RustCrypto: `sha2` / `hmac` / `aes` / `p256` / `rsa` / …) and platform glue
  (`pcsc`, `hidapi` on macOS/Windows, `clap`, `eframe`/`egui`). The per-crate list
  is in the table below, and the standing goal is to shrink it over time, not grow
  it.
- **Pure-Rust crypto** — no OpenSSL or other C crypto; the in-tree primitives are
  checked against standard test vectors, and standard algorithms come from the
  audited RustCrypto crates.
- **Secrets stay yours.** PINs and passwords come from stdin or env vars, never
  argv; the tool never prints or persists them.
- **Single static binary per OS** — no scripts, no Python, no Qt.
- **Toward native installs everywhere.** The longer-term goal is first-class
  distribution through each platform's mainstream channels (Homebrew, AUR, and
  winget today; Flatpak, AppImage, and others as they're proven out on real
  hardware), while continuing to shrink external dependencies toward a
  self-contained binary.

## Install

Build and install from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install keyroostctl keyroost
```

### Without the Rust toolchain

Each release ships pre-built binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows, so you can
skip compiling. Grab the binary for the **latest** release straight from a
stable URL (no `cargo`, no toolchain) — for Linux x86_64:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/framefilter/keyroost/releases/latest/download/keyroost-linux-x86_64.tar.gz \
  | tar xz   # then move keyroostctl / keyroost onto your PATH
```

(macOS: `keyroost-macos-universal2.tar.gz`; Windows: `keyroost-windows-x86_64.zip`.
Each release also publishes `SHA256SUMS` and build-provenance attestation.)

Or let `cargo binstall` fetch the same pre-built archive instead of compiling:

```bash
cargo binstall keyroostctl keyroost
```

keyroost is also packaged for Homebrew, the AUR, and winget — see the latest
[release](https://github.com/framefilter/keyroost/releases/latest).

### Linux prerequisite

keyroost is mostly¹ distro-neutral — it talks to the kernel's `hidraw`/`sysfs` and to
PC/SC, both of which every mainstream distribution provides. Only the package
names differ. The CLI needs the PC/SC library + daemon; the GUI additionally
needs the X11/Wayland/GL libraries that `eframe`/`egui` link against.   
¹the cargo install does not support atomic distros like Bazzite.

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install libpcsclite-dev pcscd \
  libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libxcb1-dev libgl1-mesa-dev

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo dnf install pcsc-lite-devel pcsc-lite pkgconf-pkg-config gcc \
  libxkbcommon-devel libxkbcommon-x11-devel wayland-devel libxcb-devel \
  mesa-libGL-devel

# Arch
sudo pacman -S pcsclite ccid pkgconf gcc \
  libxkbcommon libxcb wayland mesa

sudo systemctl enable --now pcscd
```

(For the **CLI only** you can drop the `libxkbcommon`/`wayland`/`xcb`/`mesa`
packages — those are just for the GUI.) macOS and Windows have PC/SC built in,
and the FIDO HID backend uses `hidapi` (IOKit / hid.dll) automatically — no extra
packages. macOS/Windows are tier-2 (best-effort, not yet hardware-verified).

> **Windows and FIDO:** Windows reserves raw FIDO HID access for elevated
> processes (the OS routes normal apps through its own WebAuthn API instead).
> Expect the `fido` commands and the Security Keys pane to require an
> elevated ("Run as administrator") session on Windows; the Molto2, OATH,
> OpenPGP, and PIV features go over PC/SC and work unelevated. Elevate for
> the FIDO command you need, then drop back — don't run the whole tool
> elevated as a habit.

> **Prebuilt binaries:** the release artifacts are built on Ubuntu and linked
> against its glibc, so they run on glibc-current distros (Arch, recent Fedora)
> but may fail on older ones (e.g. RHEL 9) with a `GLIBC_…` error. When in doubt,
> build from source with the commands above — `cargo install` handles the rest.

> **Wayland and clipboard auto-clear:** after copying an OTP code the GUI
> clears the clipboard ~45 s later, but only if the clipboard still holds that
> code. The check reads the clipboard via X11/XWayland; on a pure-Wayland
> session without XWayland clipboard sync it can't see the contents and fails
> open (nothing is cleared) rather than clobbering whatever you copied since.
> GNOME and KDE sync the two clipboards, so the clear works there; on other
> compositors treat the auto-clear as best-effort.

### FIDO HID access (Linux udev rules)

The OATH, OpenPGP, and PIV applets are reached over PC/SC and need no special
permissions. Talking to a key's **FIDO interface** (the `fido` commands, and the
Security Keys GUI pane), though, opens a `/dev/hidraw*` node, which is
root-only by default. Install the bundled udev rules to grant the logged-in user
access:

```bash
sudo cp udev/70-keyroost-fido.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

The rules use `uaccess` (and a `plugdev` fallback), are keyed by vendor/USB so
they apply before the hidraw node is created, and cover the common FIDO vendors
(Yubico, SoloKeys, Nitrokey, Feitian, Token2, and others). Re-plug the key after
installing them.

## Quick start

```bash
# discover connected devices: PC/SC readers + FIDO HID authenticators
keyroostctl list

# --- FIDO2 (YubiKey / Solo 2 / Nitrokey 3) ---
keyroostctl fido info
keyroostctl fido pin-retries
keyroostctl fido creds-list --pin-stdin        # PIN read from stdin, never argv

# --- OATH over PC/SC ---
keyroostctl oath list --reader yubikey
keyroostctl oath code <name> --reader yubikey

# --- OpenPGP card ---
keyroostctl openpgp status --reader yubikey
keyroostctl openpgp sign --in msg.txt --pin-stdin --reader yubikey

# --- PIV (read-only status) ---
keyroostctl piv status --reader yubikey

# --- Token2 Molto2 (TOTP programming) ---
keyroostctl molto info
keyroostctl molto import --profile 0 'otpauth://totp/GitHub:me@x.com?secret=JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP'
keyroostctl molto import-file ~/Downloads/aegis.json --start 0 --dry-run   # validate first

# --- Token2 on-device OTP (PIN+ Series FIDO keys) ---
keyroostctl otp list
keyroostctl otp add GitHub me@x.com --seed-stdin    # base32 seed from stdin, never argv
keyroostctl otp get GitHub me@x.com

# name a key to target it when several are plugged in (opt-in)
keyroostctl key-name list

# launch the GUI (per-device tabs: Overview, Security Keys, OATH, OpenPGP, PIV,
# On-device OTP, plus the distinct Molto2 view)
keyroost
```

## Migrating to the 0.6.0 command names

The Molto2 and FIDO commands are now nested under `molto` and `fido` groups.
The old flat names have been replaced — update any scripts as follows:

| Old (≤ 0.5.x)                       | New (0.6.0)                          |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `keyroostctl info`                  | `keyroostctl molto info`             |
| `keyroostctl set-seed …`            | `keyroostctl molto seed …`           |
| `keyroostctl set-title …`           | `keyroostctl molto title …`          |
| `keyroostctl configure …`           | `keyroostctl molto config …`         |
| `keyroostctl sync-time …`           | `keyroostctl molto sync-time …`      |
| `keyroostctl set-customer-key …`    | `keyroostctl molto customer-key …`   |
| `keyroostctl import …`              | `keyroostctl molto import …`         |
| `keyroostctl import-file …`         | `keyroostctl molto import-file …`    |
| `keyroostctl factory-reset …`       | `keyroostctl molto reset …`          |
| `keyroostctl fido-info`             | `keyroostctl fido info`              |
| `keyroostctl fido-reset …`          | `keyroostctl fido reset …`           |
| `keyroostctl fido-pin-set …`        | `keyroostctl fido pin-set …`         |
| `keyroostctl fido-pin-change …`     | `keyroostctl fido pin-change …`      |
| `keyroostctl fido-pin-retries`      | `keyroostctl fido pin-retries`       |
| `keyroostctl fido-creds-list …`     | `keyroostctl fido creds-list …`      |
| `keyroostctl fido-creds-metadata …` | `keyroostctl fido creds-metadata …`  |
| `keyroostctl fido-creds-delete …`   | `keyroostctl fido creds-delete …`    |
| `keyroostctl manpage > x.1`         | `keyroostctl manpage ./man`          |

The customer-key flags (`--key`, `--key-ascii`, `--key-env`, `--key-ascii-env`)
now live under `molto` — e.g. `keyroostctl molto customer-key --key-env K`. The
`piv`, `oath`, `openpgp`, `otp`, `key-name`, `list`, `doctor`, and `completions`
commands are unchanged.

## Protocol

The Molto2 wire protocol is documented in [`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md)
— the APDUs, the SM4-based MAC, and the TLV config payload, described as facts
about the device rather than any one implementation. The FIDO2, OATH, and OpenPGP
layers follow their respective public standards.
