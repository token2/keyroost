# It blocks commands or file reads that would surface a secret (PINs, env
# dumps, private keys, .env files, SSH keys, WiFi/NetworkManager configs).

# Destructive FIDO operations (fido-reset, fido-creds-delete) are intentionally
# NOT guarded here: this checkout is used only with disposable test keys.

# This is intentionally conservative: when something looks like it would expose
# a secret, it blocks and tells the human to run it themselves in a separate
# terminal. Tune the patterns below if it gets in the way.

# Exemption: paths under the scratch dir below hold only *disposable OpenPGP
# test keys* generated during hardware bring-up (e.g. a throwaway RSA key to
# import into a test YubiKey). They are intentionally allowed so trace/import
# flows can run in-session. Real secrets — $HOME keys, .ssh, .env, WiFi configs —
# stay blocked because they don't live under this prefix. Keep the prefix
# narrow; never widen it to a directory that could hold a real key.
#
# The scratch dir lives under $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR (per-user, mode 0700) — NOT
# world-writable /tmp. That closes a symlink-planting bypass: in shared /tmp,
# another user could create `/tmp/moltoui-test/x.pem -> ~victim/.ssh/id_rsa`,
# and the exemption would strip the path and let the read through. A 0700
# per-user runtime dir can't be written by anyone else, so a symlink there is
# the user's own. If XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is unset, the exemption is disabled
# entirely (we scan the full command) rather than guess an unsafe location.

# but ONLY when XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is set AND the command contains no `..`.
# Otherwise a traversal path like
# `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/moltoui-test/../../home/user/.ssh/id_rsa` would be stripped
# wholesale (the `[^[:space:]]*` swallows the `..` and everything after),
# bypassing the scan and exposing a real key. In either unsafe case we fail
# closed and scan the full, unstripped command, so traversal can never reach a
# real secret.
